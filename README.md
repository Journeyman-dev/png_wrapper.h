# libpng wrapper

Libpng is a monster of a library that can be cumbersome to use. For this reason, simpler to use alternatives such as the stb header only libraries are often used by programmers who are developing small video game projects. However, these smaller libraries are often much slower than libpng, lack features that libpng has, have bugs with loading images of certain formats, and are plagued with known security vulnerabilities that noone cares for fixing. Libpng has unmatched quality, security, and performance, due to its contant development since 1995, and is widely considered to be the industry standard for png image loading. This header only library is made to simplify libpng usage so that it is more simillar to the stb libraries, to make it easier for indy game and game jam developers to integrate into their projects.
